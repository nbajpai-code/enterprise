# Summary: McKinsey Interview with Nathaniel Whittemore on Enterprise AI Transformation

This document summarizes the insights from an interview between Erik Roth (McKinsey) and Nathaniel Whittemore (Founder and CEO of Superintelligent, and Host of the AI Daily Brief podcast).

## The Core Problem: The "Enablement Gap"

Superintelligent is an AI planning platform designed to help enterprises navigate the complex transition of integrating digital and human workforces. Whittemore identifies a significant **"enablement gap"**—the disparity between the value enterprises *want* to achieve with AI and the value they are *actually* extracting. 

To address this, Superintelligent has evolved through several iterations:
1. **Education Platform:** Initially focused on teaching employees how to use AI tools.
2. **Team Sharing:** Evolved to help teams share *what* to use AI for, as knowing how to use tools didn't solve the problem of identifying high-value use cases.
3. **Agent Planning & Readiness Audits:** Currently focused on deploying voice agents to interview employees at scale, identifying where AI agents can be most effectively deployed across the organization.

## The "Plateau Breaker" Phase

Whittemore notes that many enterprises are now 12 to 24 months into their AI strategies and have hit a "plateau." The common bottlenecks include:
- **Data Readiness:** Running into limits regarding what can be done with existing data infrastructure.
- **Coordination & Governance:** Fragmented strategies where different business units are at vastly different stages of AI adoption.
- **Process Mapping:** A realization that automating workflows requires mapping them out first, but the knowledge of how things currently work is often undocumented and locked in employees' heads.

## Philosophy on Product Building and the Future

- **Avoiding Short-Term Fixes:** While workflow process mapping is in high demand, Whittemore views traditional process mapping as shortsighted. He believes future AI agents won't just imitate human workflows; they will invent entirely new, superior ways of accomplishing tasks.
- **The Role of the Podcast:** The *AI Daily Brief* serves not just as a marketing funnel, but as a "macro knowledge" aggregator. It provides a high-level view that perfectly complements the "applied intelligence" gained from Superintelligent's ground-level enterprise work.
- **Predictions for 2026:**
  - A massive emphasis on **context, engineering, and data readiness**.
  - A shift toward prioritizing **ROI** and the beginnings of standardized benchmarks.
  - A critique of current deployment models: Enterprises need to stop assuming employees will figure out how to use AI on their own (the "sandbox" approach) and instead provide clear, curated use cases to guide them.

## Personal AI Usage

Whittemore's personal high-value use case for AI is using chatbots as a thought partner for **collaborative business strategy brainstorming**, using them to refine and sift through ideas.
